Ad Agency Management System Pseudocode

Data Structures:
- Campaign class: Represents an advertising campaign
    - Properties: name, active status, dayparting (time restrictions)
    - Methods for: checking if campaign should run, turning on/off

- Brand class: Represents a client brand
    - Properties: name, budgets (monthly/daily), campaigns list, spend tracking
    - Methods for: campaign management, spend tracking, budget checks

Main Flow:
1. Create Brand instance with:
   - Brand name
   - Monthly budget limit
   - Daily budget limit
   
2. Create Campaign(s) with:
   - Campaign name
   - Active status (default true)
   - Optional dayparting hours (start_hour, end_hour)
   
3. Add campaigns to brand using add_campaign()

4. For each ad spend:
   a. Track spend using accumulate_spend()
   b. Check if budgets exceeded
   c. Turn off campaigns if needed
   
5. Daily operations:
   - Reset daily spend at start of new day
   - Turn campaigns back on if budget allows
   
6. Monthly operations:
   - Reset monthly spend at start of new month
   - Turn campaigns back on if budget allows

- Re-enable campaigns when budgets reset if within limits

Time Management:
- Check campaign dayparting restrictions
- Only run campaigns during allowed hours
- Reset budgets based on current date vs last reset date
